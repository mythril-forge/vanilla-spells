## Description
You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range.
The target must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw, or it takes `1d6` poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet.
Roll a `d4` for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west.
This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

The spell's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
