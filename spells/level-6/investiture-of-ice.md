## Description
Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits:
- You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.
- You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.
- The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.
	The radius moves with you.
- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose.
	Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
	A creature takes `4d6` cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.
