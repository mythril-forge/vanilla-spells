## Description
You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded.
The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range.
The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore `1d6` hit points to that creature (no action required).
The spirit can't heal constructs or undead.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 2nd.
