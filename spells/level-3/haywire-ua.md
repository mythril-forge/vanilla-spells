## Description
This spell plays havoc with electronic devices, making the use of such devices all but impossible.
Each electronic device in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range is subject to random behavior while it remains within the area.
A device not held by a creature is automatically affected.
If an electronic device is held by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the device affected by the spell.

At the start of each of your turns, roll a `d6` for each affected device to determine its behavior.
Except where otherwise indicated, that behavior lasts until the start of your next turn while this spell is in effect.
| `d6`      | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1         | The device shuts down and must be restarted. Do not roll again for this device until it is restarted. |
| 2&mdash;4 | The device does not function. |
| 5         | The device experiences a power surge, causing an electric shock to the wielder (if any) and one random creature within 5 feet of the device. Each affected creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking `6d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 6         | The device is usable as normal. |

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the sphere affected by the spell increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
