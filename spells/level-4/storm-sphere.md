## Description
A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence, centered on a point you choose within range.
The sphere remains for the spell's duration.
Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or take `2d6` bludgeoning damage.
The sphere's space is difficult terrain.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center.
Make a Ranged Spell Attack.
You have advantage on the Attack Roll if the target is in the sphere.
On a hit, the target takes `4d6` lightning damage.

Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) Checks made to listen.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage for each of its effects increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 4th.
