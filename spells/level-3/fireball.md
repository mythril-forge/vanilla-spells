## Description
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.
Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A target takes `8d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners.
It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 3rd.
