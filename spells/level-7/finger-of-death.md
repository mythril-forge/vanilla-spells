## Description
You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain.
The target must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
It takes `7d8 + 30` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.
