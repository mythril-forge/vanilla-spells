## Description
After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a *huge* or smaller beast or plant.
The target must have either no Intelligence Score or an Intelligence of 3 or less.
The target gains an Intelligence of 10.
The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know.
If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's.
Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.

The awakened beast or plant is **charmed** by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
When the **charmed** condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was **charmed**.
