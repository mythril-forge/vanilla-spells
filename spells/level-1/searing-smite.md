## Description
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra `1d6` fire damage to the target and causes the target to ignite in flames.
At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, it takes `1d6` fire damage.
On a successful save, the spell ends.
If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
