## Description
You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy.
The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration.
You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick.
The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes `6d10` slashing damage.
On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
