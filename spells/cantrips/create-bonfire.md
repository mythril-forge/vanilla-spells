## Description
You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `1d8` fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.

The spell's damage increases by `1d8` when you reach 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).
