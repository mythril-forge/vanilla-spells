## Description
You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power.
Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
In addition, Weapon Attacks made with it deal an extra `2d8` radiant damage on a hit.
If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance.
Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `4d8` radiant damage, and it is **blinded** for 1 minute.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't **blinded**.
At the end of each of its turns, a **blinded** creature can make a Constitution Saving Throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
