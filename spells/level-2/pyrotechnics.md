## Description
Choose an area of nonmagical flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within range.
You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

### Fireworks
The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors.
Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become **blinded** until the end of your next turn.

### Smoke
Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners.
The area of the smoke is heavily obscured.
The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.
