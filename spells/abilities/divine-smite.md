# Divine Smite
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a Melee Weapon Attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage.
The extra damage is `2d8` for a 1st-level spell slot, plus `1d8` for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of `5d8`.
The damage increases by `1d8` if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of `6d8`.
