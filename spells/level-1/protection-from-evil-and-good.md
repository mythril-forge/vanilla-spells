## Description
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits.
Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target.
The target also can't be **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by them.
If the target is already **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
