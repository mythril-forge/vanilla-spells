## Description
The next time you hit a creature with a Ranged Weapon Attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon or ammunition.
In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `1d10` piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of `6d10`).
