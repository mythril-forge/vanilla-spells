## Description
A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius sphere from a point within range.
Each creature in that area must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
A target takes `8d6` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by `2d6` for each slot level above 6th.
