## Description
You touch a quiver containing arrows or bolts.
When a target is hit by a Ranged Weapon Attack using a piece of ammunition drawn from the quiver, the target takes an extra `1d6` fire damage.
The spell's magic ends on a piece of ammunition when it hits or misses, and the spell ends when twelve pieces of ammunition have been drawn from the quiver.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of pieces of ammunition you can affect with this spell increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.
