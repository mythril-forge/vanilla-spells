## Description
This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action.
Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a `d10` at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

| `d10`      | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| 1          | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a `d8` and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |
| 2&mdash;6  | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn. |
| 7&mdash;8  | The creature uses its action to make a Melee Attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. |
| 9&mdash;10 | The creature can act and move normally. |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
