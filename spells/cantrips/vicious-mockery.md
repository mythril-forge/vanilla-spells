## Description
You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range.
If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or take `1d4` psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next Attack Roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

This spell's damage increases by `1d4` when you reach 5th level (`2d4`), 11th level (`3d4`), and 17th level (`4d4`).
