## Description
The next time you hit a creature with a Weapon Attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or be **restrained** by the magical vines until the spell ends.
A Large or larger creature has advantage on this Saving Throw.
If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

While **restrained** by this spell, the target takes `1d6` piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.
A creature **restrained** by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your Spell Save DC.
On a success, the target is freed.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
