## Description
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range.
Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d8` thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 2nd.
