## Description
You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns.
The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration.
You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick.
The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `7d8` piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully.
For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement.
Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
It takes `7d8` slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by `1d8` for each slot level above 6th.
